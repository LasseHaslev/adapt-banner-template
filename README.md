# Banner template
> A great starting point for building product based banners.


This system uses
- [ Adapt style ](https://github.com/LasseHaslev/adapt-style)
    - [sass-asset-inline](https://github.com/LasseHaslev/sass-asset-inliner)
- [ Adapt Data ](https://github.com/LasseHaslev/adapt-data)
- [laravel-mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix)
    - [ Laravel mix extender ](https://github.com/LasseHaslev/adapt-mix-extender)

## Install

```bash
// Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/AdaptRetail/banner-template

// Go to directory
cd banner-template

// Install dependencies
npm run 
```

## Usage

### `watch`
You can see the banner when working on it simply by writing `npm run watch`.
This will start [Browser Sync](https://www.browsersync.io/) and will display you add, and refresh your content when you save files.

If you want to test your banners on different devices you can see in the terminal after you entered the command.
There will be a `External` info with a `ip-address`. 
> All the browsers will be refreshed on file save. Even the one on external devices.

### `prod`
The `npm run prod` command is minifying css and javascript and removes source maps.
The prod command will also change `AdaptData` to `LightAdaptData`.

## Building banners

The adapt banner builder is extending [laravel-mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix).

### Style

The banner builder is including [sass-asset-inliner](https://github.com/LasseHaslev/sass-asset-inliner) for base64 encoding assets.
Even though `laravel-mix` is including multiple asset compilers, the `asset-inliner` will only be included when you use the `sass` compiler.

### Helpers

#### Responsiveness
When building banners you should have the responsive thinking.
Use as much `%`, `em`, `rem` values for width and padding on elements.
And use `vw`, `em` and `rem` for texts. Never write static properties.

#### [ Media queries ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

If you write good responsive banners you almost only need to think about 3 formats.
`topbanner`, `skyscraper` and `board`.
If you make good banners it does not matter if the banner is `180x500` or `120x480`.

One of the best media queries are [ aspect ratio ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#aspect-ratio)
